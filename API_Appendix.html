      <h2>Statuses for Loyalty Cards</h2>
      Status gets returned through the API in the below structure: <br>
        <pre>
            <code>status": {</code>  
                <code>"state": "authorised",</code>
                <code>"slug": null,</code>
                <code>"description": null</code>
                <code>},</code>
        </pre>
      Please see the below tables for the different values that can populate these fields. They are separated by journey and with notes to explain how the status could get returned, with advice on how to fix issues.<br>
