# Bink API Documentation

This project contains Open API Specification documents for Bink APIs. 
The project also uses the redoc-cli tool to convert YAML files to HTML. 

YAML files named as 'deploy-\*.yaml' will be automatically converted to reader-friendly HTML and served at the docs.\*.gb.bink.com URL.

e.g., The corresponding HTML document for deploy-dev.yaml can be viewed at: docs.dev.gb.bink.com
