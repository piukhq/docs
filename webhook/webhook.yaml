  title: Bink Webhook API
  description:  "<h1>Bink webhook endpoints</h1>
    This API allows clients to register their webhook endpoints with Bink. <br><br> This API accepts a JSON body and provides HTTP response codes and a JSON response body.
    <br><br>
    This specification also describes the payload that receivers should expect to receive to their endpoints and how to respond to the request. 
    </br></br>
    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    Bink uses API keys to authenticate requests. Provide your API key in every request in the X-API-KEY header. Bink will provide each retailer with an API key upon integration. 
    <br><br>
    <h2>Errors</h2>
    Bink's API uses HTTP response codes. Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Requests that result in errors codes have a code in the 4xx range and a JSON body containing <i>error_message</i> and <i>error_slug</i> fields. 

    <h2>Versioning</h2>
    The Webhook API is versionless, all changes will be backward-compatible. Any future changes that are backward-incompatible with result in a new API operation.
