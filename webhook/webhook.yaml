  description:  "<h1>Bink Retail Transaction Webhook</h1> 
    Bink offers a webhook that notifies your customer or loyalty system that we have recognised a transaction at one of your enrolled retailers for a .
    <h2>Webhook endpoint</h2>
    To receive these notifications, you need to provide us with a URL that we can send the notifications to. We will then send a JSON payload to that URL whenever we recognise a transaction at one of your enrolled retailers.    
    </br>
    <h2>Webhook payload</h2>
    The payload will contain the information specified in this guide. You can use this information to update your customer or loyalty system with the transaction details.
    </br>
    <h2>Webhook security</h2>
    To ensure that the payload is authentic, we will include a secret key in the header (X-API-KEY). You can use this key to verify the authenticity of the request.
